HKP Compatible Keyserver 
Based upon IETF Memo by D. Shaw, drafted March 2003

Please review the /about page for examples.

Installation:
cd hkp-server
mkdir key_store
cp /some/path/my/pubring.gpg key_store/
Modify hkpconfig.cfg accordingly.

A database file (flaskr.db) will be created each time
the server is started, if it does not already exist.
On startup, this database will be initialized from the
public keyring in key_store/. It should be treated as
a temporary database. It is important to backup the
public keyring located at key_store/pubring.gpg.

Version 0.0.9 is under development, but can return a
basic key search result using the corresponding keyid.
All other methods required for compliance with the HKP
standard should return '501 Not Implemented'.

test_server.sh should not be used without modification.
It exists only for testing during development.
